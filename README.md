## About The Site Design and Look And Feel

i'm a back end developer. not a front end person.

i'm just smart enough to know to use templates b/c i don't know css at a high level.

so i used this girls repo and put my shit in there. #bigbrain

See here: https://github.com/bchiang7/v4

all look and feel and ui stuff was all brittany chiang.

im just an idiot that knew how to edit the source files and push them to dockerhub.
